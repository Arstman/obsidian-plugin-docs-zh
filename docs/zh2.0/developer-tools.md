# Developer tools

This page lists tools for plugin developers. While they're not required for building plugins, they can simplify plugin development.

## Obsidian Tools

[Obsidian Tools](https://github.com/obsidian-tools/obsidian-tools) is a collection of tools for plugin developers.

## Download all plugins locally

If you run into a problem, it can be helpful to see how others have solved it. By downloading the entire plugin library to your computer, you can search the source code to find inspiration.

## Beta testing

Before you [publish](publishing/submit-your-plugin.md) your plugin, you may want to let users try it out first.

With the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin, your beta testers can install the plugin even if it's not published yet.
