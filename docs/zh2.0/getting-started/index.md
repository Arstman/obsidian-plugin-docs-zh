# Getting started

Are you ready to start building your first [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin? This page gives you an introduction to plugins, and how to set up your development environment.

## What are plugins?

A plugin is a third-party application lets you extend or modify Obsidian to your liking. By building a plugin, you can:

- Extend or modify the user interface.
- Edit files and folders in your [Vault](vault.md).
- Improve the [Editor](editor/index.md) for a better note-taking experience.

To see what a plugin looks like, check out the [Insert link](../examples/insert-link.md) example.

## What do I need?

Before you can build plugins, you need to set up your development environment.

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that tracks changes to your code. You need Git to download the sample plugin and to publish the plugin.

### Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime environment that can run JavaScript outside of a web browser.

### TypeScript

To build a plugin, you need a basic understanding of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). A great place to start is [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html).

### Code editor

Use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write TypeScript on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Next steps

Now that you've set up your development environment, it's time to [Create your first plugin](create-your-first-plugin.md).
